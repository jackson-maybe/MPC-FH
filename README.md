# MPC-FH: Privately Estimating Frequency Histogram for Advertising Measurement
This repository includes our realization of MPC-FH, which is a secure protocol for efficiently estimating the frequency histogram in the advertising measurement, i.e. the fraction of persons (or users) appearing a given number of times across all publishers. Though MPC-LiquidLegions is a way to solve the problem, however, the protocol demands that the aggregator and workers used are assumed to be honest but curious, and it has an expensive computational cost. Our MPC-FH is based on a novel sketch method MPS++ which consistently and uniformly samples active users distributed over multiple publishers. The salient strength of our MPS++ is that it can be efficiently implemented on MPC platforms including SPDZ, which can guarantee security when computational parties are malicious. Our experimental results show that our MPC-FH accelerates the computational speed of the state-of-the-art protocol by 20â€“87 times.
